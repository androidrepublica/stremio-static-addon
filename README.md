## Using with Express

We've made a separate repository demonstrating how to use these static files with a Node.js Express Server. The example also shows how to make a locally hosted add-on accessible remotely with the help of the `localtunnel` module.

This example add-on can be found at [stremio-express-static-addon](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-express-static-addon).


### Don't know where to add the Add-on Repository URL?
